# ‚ö†Ô∏è GSAP'S PRIVATE REPOSITORY IS DEPRECATED! ‚ö†Ô∏è

Thanks to [Webflow](https://webflow.com), GSAP is now **100% FREE** including ALL of the bonus plugins like [SplitText](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/SplitText), [MorphSVG](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/MorphSVGPlugin), and all the others that were exclusively available to Club GSAP members. GSAP is even free for commercial uses now! üéâ

Instead of using this private repository that was previously intended for Club GSAP members, you should now use the standard ['gsap' package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gsap) instead. The private repository will be decommissioned around June 1, 2025.
